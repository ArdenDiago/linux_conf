# Niri (scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor) — the second of the two
# sessions this script offers alongside Hyprland (module 15). It's a
# proper package in Arch's official extra repo, no AUR/source build
# needed. xwayland-satellite gives it X11 app support the way Hyprland
# gets it natively from xorg-xwayland. polkit-gnome is shared with the
# Hyprland module (harmless no-op if already installed) since whichever
# session you pick at the SDDM login screen needs its own agent running.
#
# Unlike the Hyprland module (which pulls in xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland),
# niri has no portal package of its own — without one, apps like Firefox
# silently fail to screen-share and get a broken file picker. gnome/gtk
# below plus dotfiles/niri/niri-portals.conf (installed at the bottom)
# cover that; see that file for why those two specifically.
